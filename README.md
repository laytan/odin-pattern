# Odin Pattern: Lua's regex alternative in Odin

NOTE: a similar package has been added to core which you probably want to use instead: `import "core:text/match"`, see the docs here: [pkg.odin-lang.org/core/text/match](https://pkg.odin-lang.org/core/text/match).

Package pattern is an implementation of the patterns syntax also found in Lua.
They are a lot like regex but have some limitations and advantages.
See the Lua documentation pages for in depth coverage and examples here:
[https://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html](https://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html).
